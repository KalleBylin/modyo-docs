Modyo Customers is an application that allows users to enable Modyo sites to authenticate users, either through their internal account registration system or through their business integrations to Single Sign On (SSO) systems.

Once the user has been identified, the platform will internally manage the business events that the user performs during their session and through the functionality of Targets the Platform will be able to customize the content and experience in its navigation.

Modyo Customers represents an important element when developing digital products on the platform.

Modyo Customers also has an integrated authenticated user messaging system.

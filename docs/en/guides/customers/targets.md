# Targets

Targets is the ideal Modyo function to handle users in bulk if we need them to receive certain information.

These allow us to group our customers into different segments and thus facilitate the sending of emails or notifications.

## Interface

In the interface, you can see a list with all the targets created so far, with the name and the different specifications that allow them to be filtered.

The list is sorted as follows.

- Name: Particular name that has the list. (Below this are the filters that compose it).
- Created on: Target creation date.
- People: Number of users that belong to the target.

In addition, on the far left you will find a button with a drop-down menu that allows you to execute the following options:

- Edit: Edit the name and filters of the target.
- Delete: Delete the target.

::: warning Warning
If you delete the target, you will have to elaborate it again. However, this does not mean that you delete the users that belong to it.
:::

If you need to search for a specific target by name, you can do so through the search bar at the top of the screen.

## Create a Target

To create a target, you have to click on the **New Target** button at the top of the screen.

A view will open immediately in which you can select the filters you want for each Target.

If you want to delete a filter of the target you are putting together, you just have to click on the icon on the right side of the screen.

If you want to erase all filters, you can click on the **Clean** button all that is at the bottom of the screen.

To record your target, you just have to click on the **Save as Target** button, which is at the bottom of the screen.

Finally, if you want to see the users that integrate that target, you just have to click on the **Apply** button. With this, you will get to the view of [Users]/guides/customers/users.html) that will show you a list with all the contacts that fit your filters.

::: tip Tip
 It is necessary that the file of each client is complete, since each of the data that appears in it, can be taken into account to better segment. If the file is not complete or there is no customer data to filter, it will not be added to the target.

### Filters

The filters are the ones that allow us to create the targets, which, as we said before, are based on the information that appears on the client file and its activity within the site.

The filters found by default on the platform are:

- Active desactive
- Age
- Born in
- Custom field value
- Device
- Mail delivered
- Unread mail
- Mail not open
- Mail reported as spam
- Open mail count

- Registration date
- User tags
- Form responses
- Order confirming
- Order confirmed
- Complete order
- Order paying
- Paid order
- Order rejected

To create an advanced filter, which fits your needs, you must go to the Custom Fields section, which is located in [Customers Settings](/guides/customers/users.html # customers-settings).

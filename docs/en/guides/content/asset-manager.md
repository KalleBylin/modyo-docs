# File Manager

An organization needs to have a platform that allows them to organize the files and content documents that are required within the platform.

So that it is not necessary to use external services, Modyo allows you to upload, review and edit files within the same platform, through the File Manager tool.

To access the tool, it is possible to do it in two ways. The first consists of an integration within the same forms where content is being edited, either in Spaces or Sites.


#### Rich Text

#### Multiline

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/3.jpg" style="margin: 20px 0">

#### Assets Selector

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/4.jpg" width="150px" style="margin: 20px 0">


The second one is directly through the file manager tool found in the Content section.

## About the interface

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/1.jpg" width="600" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin: 20px 0">

The first interface we will see is a list of all the files we have within the platform.

In the upper right part of the screen you can see the percentage of space used corresponding to the total allocated for the account and the button to upload new files.

The list has three types of filters that will be useful to find a file.

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/7.jpg" width="400" style="margin: 20px 0">

**Extensions**: With this filter you can see all the files of the same type that are within the platform (the list is made up of the types of files that have been uploaded to the platform).

**Tags**: This filter allows you to display all the files associated with a tag that are inside the platform.

::: tip Tip
If you want to add a label to a file or a group of files, you can do so by directly editing the file or using the massive actions that appear in the lower left of the list, it will appear as soon as you select the first element (by clicking on the checkbox of the first column)
If you select one or more checkboxes that are on your screen, the button will only assign tags to those files that you have marked.

:::

**Search bar**: With the search bar, the Manager will show you all the files that have a word or content that is within its metadata. In this case, it also includes the search for your specific extension, tag, name or user who uploaded it.

::: tip Tip
Modyo allows to display only 30 files at a time. This comes by default and it is not possible to change it.
:::

For this view, the columns are:

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/8.jpg" style="margin: 20px 0">

Those with arrows can be sorted ascending and descending. The default sort order **is the update date of the files.

** Preview **: If the platform identifies that the file is an image, you will see a small thumbnail of it. If it is not, this space will appear blank.

** Name **: File name with the extension included. The ordering is in alphabetical order.

** Type **: File type and extension. The ordering is in alphabetical order first by type and then by the letter of the name of the extension.

** Size **: Size in kilobytes of the file.

** Created on **: Upload or creation date within the platform, independent if the file was created on a different date in another service.

** Author **: Name of the user who uploaded the file, as long as the user has a name assigned.

Finally, in the lower right corner, you can find the pagination of all system files.


## File Properties

The platform allows the handling and upload of files of all types, without an extension limit.
However, in the case of known extensions, the platform will recognize them and classify the file according to its use and then its extension.

To access the properties of the files, you must click on its name. Thus, a modal will be raised in which you can edit each of the properties.

## Edit a file

In the file properties editing interface, you will see certain fields:

** File URL **: Displays the public URL of the file. You can copy it to your clipboard by clicking on the side icon.

** Liquid Tag **: Shows the Liquid tag of the file, to be used within the contents of the platform.

::: warning Warning
Neither the URL nor the Liquid Tag is possible to change through Modyo.

** Title **: Shows the title of the file. This section is different from the file name, which cannot be changed.

** Alternative text **: Shows the ``` alt text``` of the element. (Only applies to images and videos).

## Recover an image

## Edit an image

To facilitate the handling of images within the platform,** Modyo includes an image editor **that allows small changes to be made online.

One of the changes that can be made is** edit the image measurements **. To do this, click on the** pencil **icon found in the Update Information window.

After that, another window will be displayed in which you will have two views. The original image and the preview of the edited image.

If you want to reissue the file or restore it, you can return to the Update Information window, where you will find the** Restore Original **button, which will cause the image to return to its original state but the modified one will be permanently lost.

## Delete a file

# Modyo Content

Modyo Content is an application that allows the creation of dynamic content repositories called spaces. Within a space, both the types of content to be managed and the access rules and roles that the different team members will have are defined.

Modyo Content has a Headless architecture that allows content to be consumed via an HTTP API both from channels defined in Modyo Channels and from external systems or applications.

Thanks to its integrated HTTP Headers cache and management system, the contents can also be hosted on CDNs for greater availability and access speed, regardless of geographic location.

### Main functionalities

- [Spaces](/guides/content/spaces.html) for the organization of contents and teams that manage them.
- [Content types](/guides/content/types.html) to define custom structures.
- [File manager](/guides/content/asset-manager.html) for organizing files such as images or videos that are used within the contents.
- [API and SDKs](/guides/content/public-api-reference.html) for access to content repositories, both on and off the platform.

# Categories

The categories allow you to sort the posts you publish according to the content that is inside, so it is useful if we need to make directories of specific areas of knowledge.

## Create a Category

To create a category, click on the top button on the screen. There you must assign a Title and a Route to the category.

This step also serves to create subcategories. To do them, the same steps must be done but the corresponding Parent Category assigned.

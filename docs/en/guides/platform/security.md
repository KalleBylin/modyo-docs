## Activity logs

The platform allows you to see all the movements that have been made for as long as you have it active.

In this section, you can filter by date, type of movement or user that will allow you to track correctly.

In addition, you will have the possibility to see the detail of what was done and from what section it was made.

This can help you in the case of having many internal users of the platform or to detect errors and changes in the production and development chain.



## Security

In this section we can activate Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), in order to access Modyo data from other websites that are not necessarily secure.

When enabling it, you must specify the domains that you want to be enabled so that they are sharing resources with your site.

After this, the platform will give you a limited time token via JSON, so you can link the sites.

Always remember that this can also mean a security flaw, so make sure that the data that is shared is free of malware or other dangerous files for our platform and clients.

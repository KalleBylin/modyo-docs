### Customers

Just as in Digital Factory we can see a direct statistic of the team members, Customers can obtain a global overview of what our customers do within it and the behavior of the content that has reached them.

The available filters are:

- Date range
- Target
- Site

**Active users**: Counting of all users with two or more activity records in the selected period.

**Activity**: Corresponds to the logon count, form responses, open emails, emails notified as spam, open notifications.

**Logins**: Corresponds to the count of all user logins.

**Records**: Corresponds to the count of all user records.

You can select any of these value counts to compare:

- **Activity**: Gather all the actions below.
- **Active users**: Includes all users who have performed two or more actions in the specified period of time.
- **Mail delivered**: Contemplate all emails from campaigns that were successfully sent.

- **Email notified as spam**: Corresponds to the counting of all emails from campaigns that were notified as spam by users.
- **Form response**: Corresponds to the counting of all Modyo form responses.
- **Login**: Corresponds to the count of all user logins.
- **Open notification**: Corresponds to the count of all user notification message openings.

### Recent Campaigns

Displays a list of the last 5 messaging campaigns sent, with a reason for the open messages versus the scope of that shipment.

In this list, you can find both email campaigns and notification campaigns.

### Recent Forms

You will see a list of the latest forms created, along with the counting of responses to these.

### Engagement

Finally, you can also visualize through a donut chart, the percentage of active users on the site (in the selected period), compared to the total number of users.

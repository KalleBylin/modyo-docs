### Digital Factory

Digital Factory allows you to view statistics related to the flow of creation and publication of content and your digital channels. You can use the filters in the upper right to visualize different aspects of the data.

The available filters are:

- Date range
- Site
- Space

::: warning Warning
When you filter by site, the elements that use space data will not contribute their data in the count, and at the same time, if you filter by space, the elements that use data from sites will not contribute to the data count.

### Activity by type

You will see five boxes that will represent the number of items created, modified, submitted for review, approved and published. The elements that are grouped in these boxes are entries, page, navigation, widgets and templates.

**Created**: Account every time an entry, page or widget is created.

**Edited**: Account every time the "save" action is used on entries, pages, navigation, widgets and templates.

**Sent for review**: Account every time in a place or space with the team review activated, an item is sent for review.

**Approved**: Account every time the restrictions of the team review are met and an item is ready to be published.

**Published**: Account every time an item is published, either on a site or space without team review (direct publication), or through team review, or also, through the "force post" action "of the administrators.

Next to each main counter, you will see an upward (green) or downward (red) indicator that represents whether the ratio between the current period and the previous one increased or decreased. If the counter is not present, it indicates that there is no data in the previous period.

::: tip Tip
The time ranges that are compared in each of the boxes, depend on the date range selected in the upper right part of the view, so that, if you have selected the last seven days, you will be comparing, for example, the amount of elements created within the last seven days, with the amount of elements created within the previous week.

### Resources Created vs. Posted

A line chart that represents a comparison over time between resources created versus those published.

With this graphic you can show how much of the content that is created is published, and visualize, for example, if all the content created is published, or if the content created is published multiple times.

::: tip Tip
The total range of dates on this chart depends on the total range of dates selected in the filter at the top right of the page.

### Activity per user

This heat map allows you to visualize the detailed activity of the administrators with more activity of your team, separating in columns the count of elements created, modified, sent for review, approved and published.

### Activity by content

This graph allows you to compare the activity of each Modyo element, both of your sites and your spaces. You can see horizontal bars that correspond to the amount of elements of that type, in any state.

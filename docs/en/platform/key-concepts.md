# Modyo key concepts

Below you will find a brief explanation of some of the key concepts related to the Modyo Platform.

### Multi-Site Architecture

Modyo implements an easy-to-manage Multi-Site architecture. From a single account, you can create multiple public or private sites.

Go further, and use Modyo to get more complete knowledge about your digital customers.

### Customers interact on sites depending on context

Modyo provides you with different authentication mechanisms, from OpenID Connect to OAuth2 and Google, so you can easily authenticate your customers.

Clients can interact in different sites and in different contexts, maintaining the same central profile that facilitates administration tasks.

### Both CMS and Headless CMS

Modyo Content allows you to create and publish content. You can add fields to define custom content structures easily. Modyo Channels allows you to work with HTML templates and reusable Front End components called widgets.

All structured content that you publish generates an equivalent JSON file that can feed any other site or application. These are served through the Content API.

### An integration platform

Modyo is designed to facilitate the creation of digital solutions integrated with the central systems of enterprises. With this in mind, we keep our focus on facilitating the development of widgets and their integration with APIs.

The widget generator helps Back and Front End developers work together to create digital experiences connected to APIs. Our governance model allows digital teams to easily preview and publish their work to their digital channels in record time.

### Widgets vs Portlets

Most of our competitors chose the old _portlets_ model (server-side development model). This is slower and requires publishing to production every time a change is made, making digital work more complex.

Modyo bases its development model on widgets and a widget generator that tracks every change in a version control system. Digital work is easy to audit, move on to the next stage and publish so that it is quickly available to your customers.

### Our widget generator

With the widget generator you can develop any type of widget you require and include all necessary HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can connect widgets to your APIs, and publish them to your widget library to reuse them when needed.

The widget generator enhances the digital experience by making Front End development easy to handle, quick to send to production and easy to audit, providing greater security and fulfillment of your key objectives.

### Prefabricated widgets for financial services

Modyo Banking provides prefabricated financial widgets to accelerate the development of your _retail_ and _wealth management_ banking experiences.

A separate license model applies to Modyo Banking.

### Liquid Markup and APIs

Modyo uses Liquid Markup within the platform to give Front and Back End developers rich language that allows them to add more functionality when building digital experiences. Liquid Markup is used by leading companies to easily add more logic to the Front End code.

APIs enhance our platform and make it easier to build solutions.

### Prepared for the future: PWAs

Progressive Web Applications will be the future of the Web, as they improve the way applications are distributed to end users and give the Web _browser_ more prominence as an execution platform. Within each channel in Modyo, you can control the definitions of _manifest.json_ and the _Service Workers_, fundamental technical enablers when implementing PWAs.

### Security, Governance and Agility

Modyo has an architecture where all published code generates versions. Before publishing a version of a widget or layout, you can easily review the code changes between one version and another.

Agility occurs when you have a greater predictability of your team's capacity, following a model that balances governance and agility. When Team Review is activated on the platform within Channels, two people (a Reviewer and an Approver) can change the status of digital resources to "Published" through a formal, easy-to-handle process. You can monitor your team's capacity within Insights.

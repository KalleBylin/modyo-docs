# Versions

The Modyo Platform is currently distributed in two versions: Modyo Cloud and Modyo Enterprise. Modyo Cloud is deployed in a _multitenant_ cloud in Amazon Web Services (AWS), in which resources are shared between different clients. Modyo Enterprise is available in either a _Private Cloud_ or _On Premise_ deployment. A Modyo Private Cloud client may also choose to use a less stable version, but benefits from the most recent improvements.

::: tip Current versions
The current version of Modyo Cloud corresponds to version **9.0**. The current version of Modyo Enterprise corresponds to the **8.2 LTS** (Long Term Support).
:::

In the case of both the Cloud and Enterprise Cloud versions, each license includes 24x7 infrastructure support services.

## Modyo Cloud
The Modyo Cloud is a multitenant public cloud deployment, and receives continuous _releases_ which are managed and operated by Modyo in a _Software as a Service_ (SaaS) model.


## Modyo Enterprise Cloud
The Modyo Enterprise Cloud is a single tenant, private cloud deployment, in an isolated environment guaranteeing greater security, availability and flexibility to make configurations that are tailored to your needs and are unavailable in the Cloud version.


## Modyo Enterprise On Premise
Modyo Enterprise corresponds to the stable _releases_ of the platform, which are previously validated in the Cloud version.

::: tip LTS Versions
Some of the Modyo Enterprise releases receive Long Term Support, or LTS, which has extended support for security patches and critical updates.

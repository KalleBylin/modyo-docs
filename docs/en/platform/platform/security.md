## Activity logs

The platform allows you to see all activity and changes made for the entire duration of the platform's existence.

In this section, you can filter by date, activity type, or platform team member.

In addition, you can see the details of what activity was done, and from what area of the platform it originated.

These activity logs help you monitor when you have many concurrent users making updates and changes within the platform, or to detect errors and changes in the production and development chain.

In this section we can activate Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), in order to access Modyo data from other websites that are not necessarily secure.

When enabling it, you must specify the domains that you want to be enabled so that they can retrieve resources with your site.

After this, the platform will give you a time limited token via JSON, so you can link the sites.

Always remember that this can be a potential security flaw, so make sure that the data that is shared is free of malware or other dangerous files for your platform and clients.

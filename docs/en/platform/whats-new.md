# What's new in Modyo?

Modyo Cloud and Modyo Enterprise Cloud version 9 correspond to the latest versions of the platform and represent a great evolution compared to previous versions in terms of performance, modularity, availability and functionalities that enable better control and management of the digital customer experience. 

In this new platform version, we highlight the following improvements and new features.

### New Simplified Interface

[A new, simplified and cleaner user interface](/en/platform/core/the-modyo-interface.html) that now also allows you to change the Modyo logo within your account to any logo you like.

### New Modyo Content application

The Modyo Content application now serves content through its [API and SDKs](/platform/content/public-api-reference.html) as a _headless_ solution, and also serves decoupled content within Modyo Channels through [Liquid](/platform/channels/liquid-markup.html).

### Asset Manager

The new asset manager allows users to upload, search, and manage various file types, and now has additional features such as _tag management_, image resizing, and more.

### User Kingdoms

Allows you to define multiple end-user realms and assign them uniquely across different sites and content spaces. With this new functionality, end user databases can be managed in a cleaner and separate way, granting differentiated access to different managed resources on the platform and reduced the need to manage separate organizations for different types of users.

### Team Review

Evolution of the old _workflows_ functionality, which allows you to improve the collaboration experience with group review and change approval tools. Team review can be configured in different ways between different sites and content spaces.

### New and simplified roles and permissions

The management of roles and permissions for sites and content spaces has been simplified, allowing you to streamline your developments. In addition, a user group functionality is incorporated, allowing you to assign roles in a very simple way within the sites and content spaces.

### Separation of users and administrators

Modyo 9.0 improves user management by completely separating users from the front end (site visitors, people who interact with your channels) from administrators (users with assigned roles, content managers, channel developers, engineers, etc.). User and administrator access panels are now separate, allowing integration of a separate identity management service and a custom look.

### Support for PWA

Modyo now has native support for Progressive Web Application enablers, allowing you to improve your users' experience when they are intermittently or lose their connection.

Modyo now has native support for Progressive Web Applications, which allow you to improve your users' experience by providing digital channels that pre-cache key resources. This makes it possible to instantly load reliable experiences quickly regardless of intermittent or bad network connections, and can be installed by the user without the need for an app store.

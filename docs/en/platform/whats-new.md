# What's new in Modyo?

In the new version of the platform, Modyo 9.0, we highlight the following new features:

### New simplified interface

A new, simplified and cleaner user interface that now also allows you to change the Modyo logo within your account to any logo you like.

### New Modyo Content application

The Modyo Content application now serves content through its [API and SDKs](/en/platform/content/public-api-reference.html) as a _headless_ solution, and also serves _decoupled_ content within Modyo Channels through [Liquid](/en/platform/channels/liquid-markup.html).

### Asset Manager

The new asset manager allows users to upload, search, and manage various file types, and now has additional features such as _tag_ management, image resizing, and more.

### Team Review

Modyo's new Team Review system is the evolution of the earlier _Workflows_ functionality, which improves team collaboration with tools for review and approval of changes to content and other elements within the platform. Team Review is also more detailed, allowing you to enable or disable review systems, assign specific team members to their respective roles, and customize separate rule sets in any content space or digital channel.

### New and simplified roles and permissions

The management of roles and permissions for sites and content spaces has been simplified, allowing you to streamline your development and content production.

### Separation of users and administrators

Modyo 9.0 improves upon user management by completely separating users in the front end (site visitors, people interacting in your channels) from the administrators (users with assigned roles, content managers, channels developers, engineers, etc.). User and administrative login panels are now separate, allowing for independent identity management service integration, and a custom look-and-feel.

### Support for PWA

Modyo now has native support for Progressive Web Applications, which allow you to improve the experience of your users by providing digital channels that pre-cache key resources to instantly load reliable experiences that load quickly regardless of intermittent or bad network connections, and are installable on user home screens without the need for an app store.

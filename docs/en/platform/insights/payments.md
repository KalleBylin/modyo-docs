# Payments

Modyo also displays a statistics of transactions within the site, which end users have performed over the last time.

These numbers can be viewed according to Date, Order Status and Method of Payment.

### User activity

In this section you can see the number of orders entered, the items sold and the income received during that time, along with a comparison to the previous period.

The states of the orders are also dynamically plotted, in order to make a comparison over time.

### Orders by Payment

This graphic allows us to compare the use of the different types of payment methods that we have installed within our e-commerce, through the amount of transactions that have been made through them.

### Orders by Current Status

Finally, we can see the effectiveness of the movements of our e-commerce, with the status of the orders of the last time, showing the amount of movements in pending payment status, paid, rejected, canceled, pending confirmation, failures and completed.

### Digital Factory

The Digital Factory allows you to monitor statistics related to the creation, editing, and publishing of content and other elements in your digital channels. You can use the filters in the upper right to visualize different aspects of the data.

The available filters are:

- Date Range
- Site
- Space

:::warning Warning
When you filter by site, the elements that use space data will not display in the interface, and likewise, if you filter by space, elements from Modyo Channels that use data from sites will not display.

### Activity by type

You will see five boxes that will represent the number of items created, edited, sent to review, approved and published within a given date range. The elements that are grouped in these boxes are entries, pages, navigation, widgets and templates.

**Created**: Number of times an entry, page or widget is created.

**Edited**: Number of times the "save" action is used on entries, pages, navigation, widgets and templates.

**Sent to Review**: Number of times in a place or space with the team review activated, an item is sent for review.

**Approved**: Count each time team review restrictions are met and an item is ready to be published.

**Publiced**: Account each time an item is published, either on a site or space without team review (direct posting), or through team review, or also, through the "force publication" action of administrators.

Next to each main counter, you'll see an up (green) or down (red) indicator that represents whether the ratio between the current and previous period increased or decreased. If the counter is not present, it indicates that there is no data in the previous period.

::: tip Tip
The time ranges that are compared in each of the boxes depend on the date range selected in the top right of the view, so if you have selected the last seven days, you'll be comparing, for example, the number of items created within the last seven days, with the number of items created within the week before last.

### Resources Created vs. Published

A line graph that represents a comparison over time between created versus published resources.

With this graphic you can show how much content is created is published, and view, for example, if all created content is published, or if the created content is published multiple times.

:::tip Tip
The total date range on this chart depends on the total date range selected in the filter at the top right of the page.

### Activity by user

This heatmap allows you to view the detailed activity of the most active administrators on your team, separating into columns the count of items created, modified, submitted for review, approved and published.

### Activity by content

This graph allows you to compare the activity of each Modyo element, both your sites and your spaces. You can see horizontal bars that correspond to the number of elements of that type, in any state.

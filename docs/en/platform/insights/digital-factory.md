### Digital Factory

Digital Factory allows you to view statistics related to the flow of content creation and publication of your digital channels. You can use the filters at the top right to view different aspects of the data.

The available filters are:

- Date Range
- Site
- Clearance

:::warning Attention
When you filter by site, items that use space data will not contribute their data into the count, and at the same time, if you filter by space, items that use site data will not contribute to the data count.

### Activity by type

You will see five boxes representing the number of items created, modified, submitted for review, approved, and published. The elements that are grouped in these boxes are posts, page, navigation, widgets, and templates.

**Created**: Account each time an entry, page or widget is created.

**Edits**: Count every time you use the “save” action on posts, pages, navigation, widgets and templates.

**Sent for Review**: Account each time in a site or space with team review enabled, an item is sent for review.

**Approved**: Count each time team review restrictions are met and an item is ready to be published.

**Publiced**: Account each time an item is published, either on a site or space without team review (direct posting), or through team review, or also, through the “force publication” action of administrators.

Next to each main counter, you'll see an up (green) or down (red) indicator that represents whether the ratio between the current and previous period increased or decreased. If the counter is not present, it indicates that there is no data in the previous period.

::: tip Tip
The time ranges that are compared in each of the boxes depend on the date range selected in the top right of the view, so if you have selected the last seven days, you'll be comparing, for example, the number of items created within the last seven days, with the number of items created within the week before last.

### Resources Created vs. Published

A line graph that represents a comparison over time between created versus published resources.

With this graphic you can show how much content is created is published, and view, for example, if all created content is published, or if the created content is published multiple times.

:::tip Tip
The total date range on this chart depends on the total date range selected in the filter at the top right of the page.

### Activity by user

This heatmap allows you to view the detailed activity of the most active administrators on your team, separating into columns the count of items created, modified, submitted for review, approved and published.

### Activity by content

This graph allows you to compare the activity of each Modyo element, both your sites and your spaces. You can see horizontal bars that correspond to the number of elements of that type, in any state.

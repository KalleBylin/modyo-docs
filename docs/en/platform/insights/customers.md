### Customers

Similar to how the Digital Factory provides direct statistics of our team members' activities, Customers gives us a global overview of what our customers are doing in the platform, as well as the behavior of the content that reaches them.

The available filters are:

- Date Range
- Target
- Site

**Active users**: Total users with two or more activity records in the selected period.

**Activity**: Corresponds to the total login count, form responses, open emails, emails notified as spam, and open notifications.

**Logins**: Total count of all user logins.

**Logs**: Corresponds to the count of all user records.

You can select any of these value counts to compare:

- **Activiti**: Gather all actions below.
- **Active Users**: See all users who have performed two or more actions within the specified time period.
- **Delivered**: Contemplate the count of all campaign emails that were successfully sent.
- **Open mail**: Corresponds to the count of all email campaigns opened by users.
- **Email notified as spam**: Corresponds to the count of all campaign emails that were notified as spam by users.
- **Response to forms**: Corresponds to the count of all responses to Modyo forms.
- **Login**: Corresponds to the count of all user logins.
- **Open Notification**: Corresponds to the count of all user notification message openings.

### Recent Campaigns

Displays a list of the last 5 sent messaging campaigns, with a reason for open messages versus the scope of that send.

In this listing, you can find both email campaigns and notification campaigns.

### Recent Forms

You'll see a list of the latest forms created, next to the response count.

### Engagement

Finally, you can also view through a donut chart, the percentage of active users on the site (in the selected period), compared to the total number of users.

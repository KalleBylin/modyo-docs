# Users and Roles

## Team

All internal users of the platform make up the team, and each member of the platform can have a specific role to play to take advantage of the full potential of the system.

To create and add a new team member to the platform, you must click on the top button and complete the fields. Once the registration invitation is sent to you by email, you can choose whether to send your login password in the same message.

To check all users, you can filter by their status and by their roles within the platform.

If you want to deactivate an internal user, you must click on the action button to the right. If you want to edit their data, you can use the same button, or click on their name.

### User Editing

When you enter the editing view of an internal user, you can see in the main tab a list of all their actions since registering and entering the platform for the first time.

The rest of the tabs include visible or modifiable user information:

- Sites (to which they have access)
- Role
- Credentials
- API access
- General data

## Roles

Roles are an essential characteristic of each internal user of the platform, since roles allow you to optimize the workflow that each internal user has.

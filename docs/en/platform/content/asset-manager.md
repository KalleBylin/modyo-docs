# Asset Manager

An organization needs to have a platform that allows them to organize and manage their required files and content.

**Modyo** allows you to upload, review and edit files through the Asset Manager tool, without the need to integrate with an external service.

You can access the Asset Manager in one of two ways. The first way is integrated within the platform tools where you create and edit content, either in Spaces or Sites.


#### Rich Text

#### Multiline

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/3.jpg"  style="margin: 20px 0">

#### Assets Selector

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/4.jpg" width="150px" style="margin: 20px 0">

The second one is directly through the Asset manager tool found in the Content section.

## About the interface

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/1.jpg" width="600" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin: 20px 0">

The Asset manager interface displays a list of all the files we have within the platform.

In the upper right part of the screen you can see the percentage of space used corresponding to the total allocated for the account and the button to upload new files.

The list has three different filters for useful file searching.

<img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/7.jpg" width="400" style="margin: 20px 0">

**Extensions**: Use this to filter all files of the same type within the platform (the default list displays all uploaded files).

**Tags**: This filter allows you to display all files that match all selected tags.

:::tip Tip
If you want to add a tag to a file or group of files, you can do so by directly editing the file or using the bulk actions that appear at the bottom left of the list. 

Thus, you will appear as soon as you select the first item (clicking on the checkbox in the first column.

If you select one or more checkboxes that are on your screen, the button will only assign tags to those files you've checked.

:::

**Search bar**: With the search bar, the manager will show you all files with titles or metadata that match your search terms. This also includes searches for specific file extensions, tags, and the names of users who uploaded a file.

::: tip Tip
Modyo displays 30 files at a time, and this value cannot be updated.
:::

For this view, the columns are:

 <img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/8.jpg" style="margin: 20px 0"> 

Those with arrows can be ordered ascending and descending. The default sorting option is the date of updating the files.

**Preview**: If the platform identifies that the file is an image, you can see a small thumbnail of it. If it is not, this space will be blank.

**Name**: Name of the file with the included extension. The sort is in alphabetical order.

**Type**: File type and file extension. The sort is in alphabetical order first by type and then by the letter of the extension name.

**Size**: Size in kilobytes of the file.

**Created on**: Date of upload or creation within the platform, independent if the file was created on a different date on another service.

**Author**: Name of the user who uploaded the file, as long as the user is assigned a name.

Finally, in the lower right corner, you can find the pagination of all system files.


## File Properties

 <img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/9.jpg" width="500" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin: 20px 0"> 

The platform allows the handling and uploading of files of all types, without an extension limit.

However, when it comes to known extensions, the platform recognizes them and classifies the file according to its use and then its extension.

To access the properties of the files, you must click on the file name. This way, a modal is raised in which you can edit each of the properties.

## Edit a file

 <img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/12.jpg" width="500" style="margin: 20px 0"> 

In the editing interface of the file properties, you can see certain fields:

**File URL**: Displays the public URL of the file. You can copy it to your clipboard by clicking on the side icon.

**Liquid Tag**: Displays the Liquid tag of the file, for use within the contents of the platform.

:::warning Attention
Neither the URL nor the Liquid Tag is possible to change via Modyo.
:::

**Title**: Displays the title of the file. This section is different from the file name, which cannot be changed.

**Alternative**: Displays the ```alt text``` of the element. (Only applies to pictures and videos.)

**Description**: Description of the item. It is a good practice to write a small text that references the image.

**Tags**: Displays the tags associated with the file, clicking on the box you can search and add more tags. In turn, you can click on the X of existing tags to remove the association with the file.

 <hr style="margin: 40px 0;" /> 

To save the modification of the data, you need to click on the**Update Information** button located in the bottom right of the window. 

If the data is changed but the button is not clicked to save, these modifications will be lost.

If you want to close the window and return to the Manager interface, click the**Close** button at the bottom of the screen.

## Resuming an image

If you want to upload a file again, keeping the original name and link, click the icon to upload the file in the**Update Information** window. This shows a new window where you can select a new file.

 <img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/13.jpg" width="300" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin: 20px 0"> 

## Edit an image

 <img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/10.jpg" width="500" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin: 20px 0"> 

To facilitate the handling of images within the platform, Modyo includes an image editor that allows you to make small changes online.

One of the changes you can make is to edit the image measurements. To do this, click on the**pencil** icon located in the Update Info window.

After that, another window is displayed in which you will have two views. The original image and preview of the edited image.

Then, you can see the three options you can choose to edit the size:

- ** 16:9 **: Edit the image in a 16:9 ratio.
- **Square**: Edit the image to the size of a square.
- **Free**: Edit the image to a free pixel size that you can change at the bottom of the screen.

On one side, you can see the original size of the image and the pixel size of what you've already edited.

:::tip Tip
There are two ways to change the view and cut the image with the cursor:

- **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll to zoom in.
- **Move Background:** Double-click outside the clipping area and drag the background.
:::

If you want to reedit the file or restore it, you can return to the Update Information window, where you find the **Restore Original** button, which causes the image to return to its original state but the modified one is permanently lost.

## Delete a file

To delete a specific file, click the Delete icon, which is located on the side of the file URL.

:::warning Attention
This action is irreversible. If this file is linked to a content, you cannot recover it and it appears as a broken link.
:::

## Upload a file

 <img src="/assets/img/content/asset-manager/11.jpg" width="500" style="border: 1px solid #EEE; margin: 20px 0"> 

There are two ways to upload a file for use in **Modyo**. One is through the same section from which you work and another is through the File Manager, which gives the option to take any material from the local disk to upload it to the platform.

To upload the file, click the **+ New** button at the top of the screen.

This action opens a new window that allows you to upload files in two ways:

- **Drag & Drop**: Drag from your computer's file browser to the window)
- **Traditional way**: Through the browser, clicking and selecting the files

:::warning Attention
Modyo only allows uploading 10 files at a time. If you want to upload more items, it should be done in two or more batches.
:::

- Images: 30 MB
- Videos: 200 MB
- Audios: 100 MB
- CSV: 2 MB
- Other: 100 MB

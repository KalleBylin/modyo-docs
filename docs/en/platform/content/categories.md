# Categories

Categories allow you to sort the entries you post based on the content inside, so it's useful if you need to make directories of specific areas of knowledge.

## Create a Category

To create a category, click the top button on the screen. There you must assign a Title and Route to the category.

This step is also used to create subcategories. To do these, you must do the same steps but assign the corresponding Parent Category.

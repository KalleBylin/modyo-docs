Modyo Content is an application that allows the creation of dynamic content repositories called spaces. Within a space, you can create content entries based on types that you define, and administrators can entry publishing as well as space access configurations for team members.

Modyo Content has a "headless" architecture that allows access to content via an API available to both digital channels in Modyo and and to external systems and applications.

Thanks to its integrated system of cache and management of HTTP Headers, content can also be hosted on CDNs for greater availability and access speed, regardless of geographic location.

### Main functionalities

- [Spaces](/en/platform/content/spaces.html) for the organization of contents and teams that manage them.
- [Content types](/en/platform/content/types.html) to define custom structures.
- [Asset manager](/en/platform/content/asset-manager.html) for organizing files such as images or videos that are used within the contents.
- [API and SDKs](/en/platform/content/public-api-reference.html) for access to content repositories, both on and off the platform.

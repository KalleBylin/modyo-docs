# Modyo Content

**Modyo Content** is an application that allows the creation of dynamic content repositories called spaces. Within a space you define both the types of content to manage and the access rules and roles that different team members will have.

**Modyo Content** has a Headless architecture that allows content to be consumed via an HTTP API from channels defined in **Modyo Channels** and external systems or applications.

Thanks to its integrated HTTP Headers management and cache system, content can also be hosted on CDNs for greater availability and access speed, regardless of geographical location.

### Key features

- [Spaces](/es/platform/content/spaces.html) for the organization of content and computers that manage them.
- [Content Types](/es/platform/content/types.html) to define custom structures.
- [File Manager](/es/platform/content/asset-manager.html) for the organization of files as images or videos that are used within the contents.
- [API and SDKs](/es/platform/content/public-api-reference.html) for access to content repositories, both on and outside the platform.

**Modyo Customers** is an application that allows account administrators with Modyo Channels to authenticate users, either through their internal account registration system or through their business integrations to Single Sign On (SSO) systems.

Once the user has been identified, the platform will internally manage the business events that the user performs during his/her session and through the Targets functionality the Platform will be able to customize the content and experience in their browsing.

**Modyo Customers** represents an important element in developing digital products on the platform.

**Modyo Customers** also has an integrated messaging system to the authenticated user.

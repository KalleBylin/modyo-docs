# Issue Policy <Badge text="Beta" type="warn"/>

Simplifies policy issuance processes by reducing the amount of data from integration with the Quotes module. Preloads information quickly and customizes issue controls to prevent fraud or deception in active co-ownerships.

| Save           | The brokers don't always have all the data at hand, this will help them with options that will generate draft policies without losing the policy issue.                                                      |
| validity dates | Allow your brokers to select only the validity date or the type of co-ownership to be insured. It saves time in filling in the data by integrating these steps with the information collected in the quoter. |
| Summary        | It presents a summary of the quote before generating it to validate cover, deductibles and offers the option of showing the percentage premium increase selected in the quote.                               |

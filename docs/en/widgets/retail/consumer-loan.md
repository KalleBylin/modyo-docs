# Personal Loan

Modyo also offers a widget that allows customers to simulate and apply for a personal loan with the information and terms they need.

### Properties

The default properties that the client can modify for its simulation and request are:

|Functionality|Description|
|:------------|:----------|
|Loan Amount|The loan amount to be requested from to the institution.|
|Payments|Shows the total payment amounts for the requested personal loan.|
Months of non-payment|This section allows customers to select the months of their grace period.|
|Grace period|If necessary, customers can select non-payment dates for their personal loan.|
|Destination account|Corresponds to the account to which the requested loan amount will be deposited.|
|Insurance|Corresponds to the selection of insurances that the client will be able to request together with their loan, if necessary.|
|

By selecting each of these options, the widget will display the amount and simulate the payment, along with a report of the attached credit details.

Lastly, a button will appear that allows the client to apply directly for the loan.
